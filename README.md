# Record-and-listen-your-voice-using-Python-Raspberry-Pi
This python code helps in recording your voice using a mic and you can also listen it after two seconds using headphones.

USB microphone is not available easily so you can use USB Audio card with two inputs.

a. In the first input, use the microphone.
b. In the second input, plug your earphones.

Run the code and then enjoy listening and recording your voice.
